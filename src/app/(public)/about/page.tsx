                    The Youth Evangelical Soldiers of Christian Assemblies (YESCA) Team is a group of passionate young believers from Christian Assemblies, formed with a burden to reach perishing young souls with the gospel of Christ. This vision was placed on the heart of Bro. D. John Moses, who earnestly prayed and sought guidance with the encouragement of the elders of that time, the youth united to form the YESCA Team.

                    The first youth camp was conducted exactly 30 years ago(1994) . Over the years, this ministry has been a blessing to thousands of young lives, many of whom now stand as living testimonies to the abundant grace and anointing of God on this work. From its humble beginnings, YESCA has grown significantly, with the 2024 youth camp hosting over 800 attendees. Through this ministry, the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20) is being fulfilled, one soul at a time.

                    YESCA organizes an annual event called Youth Camp every January during the holiday season. Alongside the camp, the team conducts youth retreats, meetings, follow-up ministries, and skill development programs, equipping young believers to grow in faith and serve God effectively. As Paul reminded Timothy, &#34;Let no one despise your youth, but be an example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity&#34; (1 Timothy 4:12). This ministry strives to live out that calling, empowering young people to stand firm for Christ and shine as His witnesses in a world in need of hope.
